# Libraries #
Python, Tkinter.

# Goal #
Download all stock symbols on the Nasdaq index and let the user track which investments they have made in the stock market over time. Automating the process of fetching current stock data, and updating a set of long term charts built on returns of investment including not just appreciating stock value but dividend payouts too.

# Desired workflows #

## Stock Tracking ##
The user can add symbols to a portfolio
The user can add events for that symbol including purchases and sales.
The program will automatically add events like dividend reinvestment (a toggle)
Any dividend payments are added to the portfolio under a Cash heading, each with individual dates and ammounts for how much money they got.


## charts ##
The user defines which existing stock portfolio to use
Switching to a charts tab, the user can see a chart which tracks the performance history of each stock in the portfolio from the time of the initial purchase to the time of today's date, or the last date the stock was owned.
